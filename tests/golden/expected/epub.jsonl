Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n2. Chapter 2: Sample Content\n\n3. Chapter 3: Conclusion\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\n\nThis is a test EPUB document created for validating EPUB processing functionality. It contains multiple chapters with different types of content to test the EPUB parsing pipeline.\n\nThe document includes:\n\nMultiple spine items for testing spine discovery\n\nVarious HTML content structures\n\nText extraction capabilities\n\nChapter navigation and organization\n\nThis content should be processed by the EPUB chunking system to extract meaningful text blocks and validate the extraction pipeline.\n\nChapter 2: Sample Content\n\nThis chapter contains sample text that mimics real EPUB content. It includes paragraphs, dialogue, and various text patterns.\n\n\"Hello, this is a sample dialogue,\" said the first speaker.\n\n\"Yes, this helps test dialogue detection in EPUB format,\" replied the second.\n\nRegular paragraph text continues here. This text should be processed as a normal paragraph block, separate from the dialogue above.\n\nSubsection with Lists\n\nThis section tests structured content processing:\n\n1. First numbered item\n\n2. Second numbered item\n\n3. Third numbered item\n\nAnother paragraph with some technical terms like PyMuPDF4LLM and text processing algorithms to test specialized handling.\n\nChapter 3: Conclusion\n\nThis final chapter concludes the test EPUB document. It provides additional content for testing the complete EPUB processing pipeline.\n\nThis is a blockquote to test different HTML element handling in the EPUB processing system.\n\nThe EPUB format allows for rich HTML content, and this test document exercises various elements to ensure comprehensive text extraction and processing.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nThis test EPUB should validate:\n\nSpine discovery and item processing\n\nHTML content extraction\n\nMulti-chapter document handling\n\nText cleaning and normalization\n\nEnd of test document."}
