Chapter 1: Introduction\n2. Chapter 2: Sample Content\n3. Chapter 3: Conclusion This is a test EPUB document created for validating EPUB processing functionality. It contains multiple chapters with different types of content to test the EPUB parsing pipeline. The document includes:\n\u2022  Multiple spine items for testing spine discovery\n\u2022  Various HTML content structures\n\u2022  Text extraction capabilities\n\u2022  Chapter navigation and organization This content should be processed by the EPUB chunking system to extract meaningful text blocks and validate the extraction pipeline.\n\nChapter 2: Sample Content This chapter contains sample text that mimics real EPUB content. It includes paragraphs, dialogue, and various text patterns.\n\n\"Hello, this is a sample dialogue,\" said the first speaker.\n\n\"Yes, this helps test dialogue detection in EPUB format,\" replied the second.\n\nRegular paragraph text continues here. This text should be processed as a normal paragraph block, separate from the dialogue above.\n\nSubsection with Lists This section tests structured content processing:\n\n1. First numbered item\n2. Second numbered item\n3. Third numbered item Another paragraph with some technical terms like PyMuPDF4LLM and text processing algorithms to test specialized handling. This final chapter concludes the test EPUB document. It provides additional content for testing the complete EPUB processing pipeline.\nThis is a blockquote to test different HTML element handling in the EPUB processing system. The EPUB format allows for rich HTML content, and this test document exercises various elements to ensure comprehensive text extraction and processing.\n\nFinal Notes This test EPUB should validate:\n\u2022  Spine discovery and item processing\n\u2022  HTML content extraction\n\u2022  Multi-chapter document handling\n\u2022  Text cleaning and normalization\n\nEnd of test document."}
