Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n2. Chapter 2: Sample Content\n\n3. Chapter 3: Conclusion\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\n\nThis is a test EPUB document created for validating EPUB processing functionality. It contains multiple chapters with different types of content to test the EPUB parsing pipeline.\n\nThe document includes:\n\nMultiple spine items for testing spine discovery\n\nVarious HTML content structures\n\nText extraction capabilities\n\nChapter navigation and organization\n\nThis content should be processed by the EPUB chunking system to extract meaningful text blocks and validate the extraction pipeline.\n\nChapter 2: Sample Content\n\nThis chapter contains sample text that mimics real EPUB content. It includes paragraphs, dialogue, and various text patterns.\n\n\"Hello, this is a sample dialogue,\" said the first speaker.\n\n\"Yes, this helps test dialogue detection in EPUB format,\" replied the second.\n\nRegular paragraph text continues here. This text should be processed as a normal paragraph block, separate from the dialogue above."}
