# AGENTS

YAML-based vocabularies for semantic enrichment during the AI pass.

## Purpose
- External configuration of structured tags.
- Modular tagging by domain (generic, philosophy, psychology, technical, PM).

## AI Agent Guidance
- Do not delete or rename existing YAML files.
- Add new vocabularies with lowercase, underscore filenames.
- Ensure YAML syntax and UTF-8 compliance.
- Tags should be additive and non-destructive.

## Known Issues
- Some tag files may not align with current classifier logic.
- Nested or overlapping domain tags may not be handled.
