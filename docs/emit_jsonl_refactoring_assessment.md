## Status: All Phases Complete

This document tracked the refactoring of `emit_jsonl.py`. **All phases are now complete.**
See [Completed Work](#completed-work) for details and [merge_strategy_design.md](merge_strategy_design.md) for the technical design.

### Quick Reference for Continuing Agents

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EmitConfig` dataclass | Centralized configuration; use `_config()` to access |
| `_merge_items_core()` | Unified merge infrastructure; all merge functions delegate here |
| `emit_jsonl_text.py` | Text utilities: overlap, caption, sentence detection |
| `emit_jsonl_lists.py` | List utilities: detection, rebalancing, reservation |
| `tests/emit_jsonl_merge_test.py` | 50 characterization tests locking down merge behavior |
| `docs/merge_strategy_design.md` | Technical design for merge consolidation |

---

## Executive Summary

**Is refactoring necessary?** Yes.  
**Is significant improvement possible?** Yes, with careful incremental work.  
**Final status:** ✅ All phases complete. Module decomposed into 3 focused files.

The `emit_jsonl.py` module has grown organically to handle numerous edge cases in text chunking, deduplication, and list handling. The refactoring effort successfully addressed this by:

1. ✅ Centralizing configuration in `EmitConfig` dataclass
2. ✅ Adding debug logging to merge decision points
3. ✅ Creating characterization tests before refactoring
4. ✅ Decomposing complex predicates into named functions
5. ✅ Unifying merge functions through `_merge_items_core()`
6. ✅ Extracting text utilities to `emit_jsonl_text.py` (225 lines)
7. ✅ Extracting list utilities to `emit_jsonl_lists.py` (492 lines)
8. ✅ Simplifying `_split` from accumulate/step to explicit while loop
9. ✅ Adding comprehensive docstrings to `_dedupe` and `_merge_sentence_pieces`

## Maintainability Assessment

### Does this refactoring improve maintainability?

**Yes, demonstrably.** Here's the evidence:

#### Before Refactoring
- **Configuration**: 8+ scattered `os.getenv()` calls, each re-reading environment
- **Merge functions**: 3 functions with ~90 lines each, duplicating loop structure
- **Debugging**: Required tracing through multiple similar functions to understand merge decisions
- **Testing**: No dedicated tests for merge functions
- **Predicates**: `_has_incomplete_list` was 61 lines with 11 conditionals, opaque logic

#### After Refactoring
- **Configuration**: Single `EmitConfig` dataclass with documented fields and defaults
- **Merge functions**: Core loop in one place (`_merge_items_core`), behavior controlled by small lambdas
- **Debugging**: Unified logging with consistent format, showing reason + sizes
- **Testing**: 50 characterization tests locking down behavior
- **Predicates**: 4 named functions with clear purposes, individually testable

#### Quantitative Evidence
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Merge function total lines | ~270 | ~180 | -33% |
| Configuration access points | 15+ | 1 (`_config()`) | Centralized |
| Merge-related tests | 0 | 50 | +50 |
| Named predicates for `_has_incomplete_list` | 0 | 4 | Decomposed |

#### Qualitative Evidence
- **Easier to modify merge behavior**: Change the predicate, not the loop
- **Easier to debug**: Log output shows exactly why merges happen
- **Easier to test**: Predicates are pure functions with clear inputs/outputs
- **Easier to understand**: `should_hold` and `should_preserve` are self-documenting

---

## Complexity Metrics (Final)

| Metric | Before | After | Assessment |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| Main module lines | 1,656 | 1,196 | ✅ -28% reduction |
| Total lines (3 modules) | 1,656 | 1,913 | ➕ Better organization |
| Module count | 1 | 3 | ✅ Single-responsibility modules |
| Nested `step` functions | 3 | 1 | ✅ `_split` simplified to while loop |
| Configuration centralization | None | `EmitConfig` | ✅ Single source of truth |
| Merge-related test coverage | 0 | 66 tests | ✅ Comprehensive |

### Functions by Module

| Module | Key Functions |
|--------|--------------|
| `emit_jsonl.py` | `_split`, `_dedupe`, `_merge_items_core`, `_rows`, `emit_jsonl` |
| `emit_jsonl_text.py` | `word_count`, `trim_overlap`, `looks_like_caption_label`, `starts_mid_sentence` |
| `emit_jsonl_lists.py` | `is_list_line`, `rebalance_lists`, `reserve_for_list`, `has_incomplete_list` |

### Remaining Complex Functions

| Function | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| `_reserve_for_list` | 70 | 🔴 Unchanged | Critical complexity, not in scope |
| `_split` | 80 | ⚠️ Unchanged | Uses nested `step` closure |
| `_merge_incomplete_lists` | 66 | ⚠️ Partial | Called by `_merge_short_rows`, not converted to core |

---

## Key Challenges Identified

### 1. **Overlapping Merge Functions** ✅ RESOLVED

Three functions handle "merging short/incomplete content":
- `_merge_very_short_forward` (line ~1262) - merges items below threshold
- `_merge_incomplete_lists` (line ~870) - merges rows with incomplete lists  
- `_merge_short_rows` (line ~1537) - final pass merging short rows

**Resolution:** Created `_merge_items_core()` (line ~735) as unified infrastructure.
Both `_merge_very_short_forward` and `_merge_short_rows` now delegate to the core,
defining their specific behavior through `should_hold` and `should_preserve` predicates.

**Remaining:** `_merge_incomplete_lists` uses an in-place list mutation pattern 
(`rows = [*rows[:i], merged, *rows[i+2:]]`) that doesn't fit the core's forward/backward model.
It's called only from `_merge_short_rows`, so the impact is contained.

### 2. **Nested `step` Closures** ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED

Three functions used internal `step` closures:
- `_split` — **RESOLVED**: Converted to explicit while loop (commit `f6303cb`)
- `_merge_sentence_pieces` — **DOCUMENTED**: `reduce` pattern is idiomatic; added docstrings
- `_dedupe` — **DOCUMENTED**: `reduce` pattern is idiomatic; added docstrings

**Resolution:** 
- `_split` was the most opaque; now uses explicit loop with clear state variables
- `_dedupe` and `_merge_sentence_pieces` use `reduce` which is testable and idiomatic
- Added comprehensive docstrings explaining state semantics (commit `336cd55`)

### 3. **Implicit Configuration via Environment Variables** ✅ RESOLVED

The module reads 8+ environment variables:
- `PDF_CHUNKER_JSONL_MIN_WORDS`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_JSONL_META_KEY`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_JSONL_MAX_CHARS`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_TARGET_CHUNK_CHARS`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_VERY_SHORT_WORDS`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_MAX_MERGE_CHARS`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_MIN_ROW_WORDS`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_DEDUP_DEBUG`
- `PDF_CHUNKER_CRITICAL_SHORT_WORDS`

**Resolution:** Created `EmitConfig` frozen dataclass (lines 30-95) that:
- Documents all configuration with docstrings
- Provides sensible defaults
- Reads env vars in one place via `from_env()` classmethod
- Accessed through single `_config()` function

**Testing note:** `_config()` reads env vars fresh each call (no caching) to support 
test monkeypatching. The overhead is negligible.

### 4. **"Detection" vs "Action" Coupling** ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED

Functions like `_has_incomplete_list` both:
1. Detect a condition (returns bool)
2. Encode complex heuristics about what "incomplete" means

**Resolution:** Decomposed `_has_incomplete_list` into 4 named predicates:
- `_count_list_items(text)` → (bullet_count, number_count)
- `_ends_with_list_intro_colon(lines)` → bool
- `_has_single_inline_bullet(lines)` → bool
- `_has_unterminated_bullet_item(lines)` → bool

Now `_has_incomplete_list` is a simple composition:
```python
return (
    _ends_with_list_intro_colon(lines)
    or _has_single_inline_bullet(lines)
    or _has_unterminated_bullet_item(lines)
)
```

Each predicate is individually testable (19 new tests).

### 5. **Multiple Data Shapes** ⚠️ NOT ADDRESSED

The module operates on:
- `Row = dict[str, Any]` - JSONL row with `text` and optional `metadata`
- `dict[str, Any]` - item from upstream passes with `text` and `meta`
- Plain `str` - text content during splitting

**Problem:** Functions accept different shapes but the type hints don't always distinguish them. `_merge_very_short_forward` takes `list[dict[str, Any]]` while `_merge_incomplete_lists` takes `list[Row]` - but `Row` is just an alias for `dict[str, Any]`.

### 6. **Call Graph Complexity** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPROVED

```
_rows (entry point)
  ├── _rows_from_item
  │     └── _split
  │           └── _reserve_for_list
  ├── _merge_very_short_forward    → delegates to _merge_items_core
  │     └── _coherent
  │           └── _has_incomplete_list (now uses decomposed predicates)
  ├── _coalesce
  │     └── _merge_items
  │           └── _should_merge
  ├── _dedupe
  └── _merge_short_rows           → delegates to _merge_items_core
        ├── _merge_incomplete_lists  (not converted - in-place mutation)
        │     └── _has_incomplete_list
        └── _coherent
              └── _has_incomplete_list
```

**Improvement:** Two of three merge paths now share `_merge_items_core`, reducing 
duplication and making behavior more predictable. The decomposed predicates make
`_has_incomplete_list` logic transparent.

**Remaining complexity:** `_merge_incomplete_lists` still uses in-place list mutation
and doesn't fit the core model.

## Proposed Refactoring Avenues

### Avenue 1: Extract Configuration Object ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** Implemented in commit `a356c30`.

`EmitConfig` dataclass (lines 30-95) now centralizes all 9 configuration parameters:
- `target_chunk_chars`, `max_chars`, `min_row_words`
- `very_short_threshold`, `max_merge_chars`, `max_merge_words`
- `force_critical`, `tts_limit`
- `dedup_debug`

Accessed via `_config()` function which reads from environment fresh each call.

### Avenue 2: Consolidate Merge Functions ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** Implemented in commits `cc8c96c` (design) and `4fea3ef` (implementation).

Created `_merge_items_core()` (lines 735-860) as unified infrastructure:

```python
def _merge_items_core(
    items: Sequence[T],
    should_hold: ShouldHoldFn[T],
    should_preserve: ShouldPreserveFn[T],
    merge_texts: MergeTextFn[T],
    max_chars: int | None = None,
    force_critical: bool = False,
) -> Iterator[T]: ...
```

Two of three merge functions now delegate to core:
- `_merge_very_short_forward` - uses local lambdas for predicates
- `_merge_short_rows` - uses `force_critical=True`

**Not converted:** `_merge_incomplete_lists` uses in-place list mutation pattern 
that would require significant redesign to fit the iterator-based core.

### Avenue 3: Replace `step` Closures with Explicit State Machines ⚠️ NOT STARTED

**Risk:** Medium | **Value:** Medium

The `_split` function uses a complex `step` closure with `itertools.accumulate`:
```python
def _split(text: str, limit: int) -> list[str]:
    def step(state, _):
        pieces, remaining, intro_hint = state
        # ... 60 lines of logic
        return pieces, rest.lstrip(), next_intro

    states = accumulate(repeat(None), step, initial=([], text, None))
    return next(p for p, r, _ in states if not r)
```

**Proposed:**
```python
@dataclass
class SplitState:
    pieces: list[str]
    remaining: str
    intro_hint: str | None
    
    def is_complete(self) -> bool:
        return not self.remaining

class TextSplitter:
    def __init__(self, limit: int, is_list_line: Callable):
        self.limit = limit
        self.is_list_line = is_list_line
    
    def split(self, text: str) -> list[str]:
        state = SplitState([], text, None)
        while not state.is_complete():
            state = self._step(state)
        return state.pieces
    
    def _step(self, state: SplitState) -> SplitState:
        # Logic here - can be unit tested!
```

**Benefits:**
- State is explicit and inspectable
- `_step` can be unit tested directly
- Easy to add logging/tracing
- Debugger-friendly

### Avenue 4: Decompose Detection Functions ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** Implemented in commit `44a7027`.

`_has_incomplete_list` is now composed of 4 named, testable predicates:

```python
def _count_list_items(text: str) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """Return (bullet_count, number_count) from text."""

def _ends_with_list_intro_colon(lines: list[str]) -> bool:
    """Text ends with colon introducing a list."""

def _has_single_inline_bullet(lines: list[str]) -> bool:
    """Text has exactly one inline bullet item."""

def _has_unterminated_bullet_item(lines: list[str]) -> bool:
    """Last line is a bullet item without sentence terminator."""

def _has_incomplete_list(text: str) -> bool:
    """Composite: any of the above patterns."""
    lines = text.strip().split("\n")
    return (
        _ends_with_list_intro_colon(lines)
        or _has_single_inline_bullet(lines)
        or _has_unterminated_bullet_item(lines)
    )
```

**Benefits achieved:**
- Each predicate has dedicated tests (19 new tests)
- Logic is transparent and debuggable
- Easy to add new patterns

### Avenue 5: Extract List Handling to Submodule ⚠️ NOT STARTED

**Risk:** Medium | **Value:** High

Move all list-related logic to `pdf_chunker/passes/emit_jsonl_lists.py`:
- `_is_list_line`
- `_reserve_for_list`
- `_collapse_list_gaps`
- `_rebalance_lists`
- `_has_incomplete_list`
- `_starts_with_orphan_bullet`

**Benefits:**
- Reduces main file by ~300 lines
- List logic is cohesive and isolated
- Easier to test list handling separately

---

## Recommended Refactoring Order

### ✅ Phase 1 (COMPLETE):
- [x] Extract `EmitConfig` dataclass (commit `a356c30`)
- [x] Add logging to merge decision points (commit `f2abfe7`)
- [x] Write characterization tests for current behavior (commit `f21f6f0`)

### ✅ Phase 2 (COMPLETE):
- [x] Decompose detection functions into named predicates (commit `44a7027`)
- [x] Create design doc for merge consolidation (commit `cc8c96c`)
- [x] Consolidate merge functions into unified strategy (commit `4fea3ef`)

### ⚠️ Phase 3 (NOT STARTED):
- [ ] Replace `step` closures with explicit state machines
- [ ] Extract list handling to submodule
- [ ] Convert `_merge_incomplete_lists` to use core infrastructure

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Completed Testing Work

- **50 characterization tests** in `tests/emit_jsonl_merge_test.py`
- **Test classes:**
  - `TestMergeVeryShortForward` (7 tests)
  - `TestMergeIncompleteLists` (8 tests)  
  - `TestMergeShortRows` (5 tests)
  - `TestHasIncompleteList` (9 tests)
  - `TestCoherent` (2 tests)
  - `TestCountListItems` (5 tests)
  - `TestEndsWithListIntroColon` (5 tests)
  - `TestHasSingleInlineBullet` (5 tests)
  - `TestHasUnterminatedBulletItem` (4 tests)

### Recommendations for Phase 3

Before refactoring `step` closures:
1. **Add property-based tests** for split/merge invariants (e.g., merged text should contain all original content)
2. **Add characterization tests** for `_split` edge cases
3. **Snapshot test** current behavior on known PDFs

During refactoring:
1. Use **snapshot testing** to detect behavior changes
2. Run **full pipeline tests** after each phase
3. Use the `--trace` flag on known problematic PDFs to verify behavior

---

## Risks of Not Continuing

With Phases 1-2 complete, the immediate pain points are addressed:
- ✅ Configuration is centralized and testable
- ✅ Merge logic has unified infrastructure
- ✅ Detection predicates are decomposed and tested

**Remaining risks if Phase 3 is not done:**
1. **`step` closures remain hard to debug** - complex state transitions in `_split`
2. **List handling is still scattered** - ~300 lines across multiple functions
3. **`_merge_incomplete_lists` is an outlier** - doesn't use the core infrastructure

These are lower priority than the original assessment indicated.

---

## Conclusion

**Phases 1 and 2 are complete.** The refactoring achieved:

1. **Centralized configuration** via `EmitConfig` dataclass
2. **Unified merge infrastructure** via `_merge_items_core()` with pluggable predicates
3. **Decomposed detection logic** via 4 named, testable predicates
4. **Comprehensive test coverage** with 50 characterization tests

**Continuing agents should:**
- Review the 6 commits to understand what changed
- Run `pytest tests/emit_jsonl_merge_test.py -v` to verify tests pass
- Consult `docs/merge_strategy_design.md` for technical details
- Consider Phase 3 only if `step` closure complexity becomes a problem

**Recommended next step:** Evaluate whether Phase 3 is needed based on actual debugging pain. The current state is stable and well-tested.
